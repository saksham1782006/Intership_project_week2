ML MODEL ON Building energy consumption to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions
Data analysis to check target variable and other relation.
Analysis all ML algorithm and perform optimize  random forest regression ML algorithim.
Get result of baseline ML model and result of performance Mean Absolute Error(mae) ,Root mean squared error(rmse) ,Coefficient of determination(R2)
Next week target to optimize error and make a good performance ml model
